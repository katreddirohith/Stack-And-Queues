# Stack-And-Queues

Write a program to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Allocate and initialize a stack and queue. Create appropriate functions for operations related to stack and queue. 

2. Add the letters 'a', 'b,' 'c,' and 'd' (in that order) to both the stack and the queue.

3. Remove all items from the stack until it is empty and print them in the order that they are returned.

4. Remove all items from the queue until it is empty and print them in the order that they are returned.

Compare the results from #3 and #4; how are they different?
